		"Description": "<p>With oily skin and acne, you're probably not always in love with your skin. But oily skin isn't all bad. One bonus: your oily skin is less prone to wrinkling than dry skin types.\r\n\r\nStill, oily skin, and the acne breakouts that often come with it, can be frustrating. With the right care, you can tame oily shine, improve acne, and learn to embrace your skin type.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>\r\nCleanse your Face at Least Twice a Day\r\n</li> \r\n\r\n<li>A simple way to keep oily skin in check is to cleanse your face regularly. Wash your face twice a day, both morning and night.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Use a foaming soap or facial cleanser over cream-based or lotion cleansers. Foaming cleansers do a much better job cleansing away excess oil and leave your skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>You should also cleanse your face (and body, if body breakouts are a problem) after you sweat, like after gym class or work out. Sweat can irritate breakouts and lead to a specific type of acne called acne mechanica.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>If soap and water aren't immediately available, keep a stash of premoistened cleansing cloths in your bag to give your skin a wipe-down. There are plenty of facial cleansing cloths on the market, but even fragrance-free baby wipes will do.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Beware of over-cleansing, though. Cleansing your face too often can irritate your skin. And since acne isn't caused by an oily or dirty face, just washing more frequently isn't going to clear breakouts</li></ul>",

Because of this, high-GI foods are believed to have a direct effect on the development and severity of acne.<br/><br/>Foods with a high glycemic index include white bread, sugary soft drinks, cakes, doughnuts, pastries, candies, sugary breakfast cereals and other processed foods.<br/><br/>Foods with a low glycemic index include fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole or minimally processed grains.<br/><br/>In one study, 43 people followed either a high- or low-glycemic diet. After 12 weeks, the individuals consuming a low-glycemic diet had a significant improvement in both acne and insulin sensitivity, compared to those eating carb-dense foods<br/><br/>Another study with 31 participants yielded similar results<br/><br/> These small studies suggest that a low-glycemic diet may be helpful for individuals with acne-prone skin, but further research is needed.<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/>Eating high-glycemic foods may increase sebum production and contribute to acne.

Breast reduction may also reduce the risk of breast cancer in women who are at high risk of the disease.<br/><br/>Mastopexy, or a breast lift, involves removing skin and glandular tissue to make the breasts smaller and rearranging the remaining tissue to make the breast appear lifted.<br/><br/>Depending on how much volume a patient has lost or desires, mastopexy can be combined with an implant. While it is similar to a breast reduction, which removes a much greater amount of tissue, mastopexy is not usually covered by major insurance carriers as it is not deemed medically necessary.<br/><br/>Male breast reduction treats gynecomastia, an enlargement of the mammary tissue in men.
